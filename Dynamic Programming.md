Types of Problems
- Optimization Problems
- Combinatorical Problems

Steps to solve DP
- Problem - Enumerate all variables
- Decision - that we can make at this stage such that we are left with smaller instance
- Recurrence - Understand the subproblem that you are left with to form relationship with bigger problem.
- Representation - Obtain a representation of subproblem
- Recursion Tree - To check for overlapping subproblems.
- Solve the smallest subproblem and then in increasing order using the same recurrence.
- Data Structure to store subproblems

Types of DP Problems
- Include/Exclude
- For Sub-arrays - Decision on last index of sub-array. | Extend a sequence(Look at Predecessor)
- First Partition | First element of the eventual solution.
