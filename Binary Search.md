# H1 Notes
- Binary Search is not applicable for all search spaces, it works on certain search spaces, which satisfies certain properties.
- When is BS applicable ? 
   1. Find a predicate - A statement that outputs boolean values in F* T* fashion.
   2. Elements you can find are Last F or First T 
   3. Time complexity - log(n) 
- When search space is not given ? optimization problem
   1. Problem Statement: Optimize (max-min) of a certain variable (x) under some constraints ( f(x) <= T or f(x) >= T ).
   2. Find Search Space
   3. Trim Search Space
   4. Define Predicate
   5. Apply Binary Search
